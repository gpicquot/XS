# XS
Simple, verbose and imperfect language favoring data oriented programming. Syntaxic complexity gradually introduced when necessary
   compiled ahead
   no programming paradigm (functional, OOP)
   compile time and run time key in the language design  
   strongly typed, types are resolved at compile time
   subtyping instead of inheritance, dynamic patching is explicited
   no exceptions, errors as values with payload
   #meta with generics and compile time programming
   @region memory management model
   structured concurrency
   ownership and affine types available, but affine type is not the standard
